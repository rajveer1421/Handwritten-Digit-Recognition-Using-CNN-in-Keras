## Handwritten Digit Recognition Using CNN in Keras (98.8% Accuracy)

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with Keras to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The model was trained on 60,000 images and tested on 10,000 images, achieving an accuracy of 98.8%.

CNNs are well-suited for image classification tasks as they automatically learn spatial features from input images. This project demonstrates how deep learning techniques can be effectively applied to digit recognition using a simple and powerful Keras implementation.

### Tools & Libraries Used:
- Python
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- Conv2D
- MaxPool2D

### Dataset:
- MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology)

This project can be extended to other image classification tasks with minimal changes.
